# push_swap
Algorithm practice that optimizes operations not under the traditional sense of big O
Ultimate goal is to sort given numbers using only two stacks and a set of limited operations in the fewest possible steps

Among compilation, two executables will be made.
push_swap produces the set of instructions to sort the given argument
checker validates whether the given set of instruction sucessfully sorts the arguments

Added Bonuses:(Checker)
1) -v option to print out stack in each step
2) -c option to print stack in colors
3) -f option to read a certain file for instructions
4) -s option for step by step animation
5) -a option for auto-play animation
